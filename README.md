### Current status:

I understand the idea behind the algorithm and its usage, but the Asian terminology used in its description is absolutely incomprehensible.
I have already involved a couple of people to expain me what the heck is the "PS Chromosome", which is never explained in the article and doesn't exist in Google.
Hope I can deal with this, but I'll need some help to work out these definitions.
